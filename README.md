# Welcome to AI Possibilities Samples

A collection of experimental demos, prototypes, and code snippets showcasing the art of the possible with AI using AWS services and open-source tools.

üåê **Visit our website**: [https://aws-samples.github.io/sample-ai-possibilities/](https://aws-samples.github.io/sample-ai-possibilities/)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: These samples are proof-of-concepts and experiments intended for learning and demonstration purposes. They are not production-ready and should not be deployed as-is in production environments.

## üéØ Purpose

This repository serves as a playground for exploring cutting-edge AI capabilities through practical examples. Each sample illustrates different AI possibilities using AWS services (like Amazon Bedrock, SageMaker) and popular open-source frameworks.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

The repository is organized into three main categories:

### **Demos** (`/demos`)
Full-featured applications demonstrating complete AI solutions. These are comprehensive examples that showcase end-to-end implementations with frontend interfaces, backend services, and AI integrations.

**Examples:**
- Voice-enabled health AI agents with real-time streaming
- Interactive chatbots with knowledge base integration
- Multi-modal AI applications

### **Experiments** (`/experiments`)
Smaller proof-of-concepts and experimental features. These focus on testing specific AI capabilities or integrations without full application scaffolding.

**Coming soon:**
- Novel AI model combinations
- Experimental features and APIs
- Quick prototypes of emerging AI patterns

### **Snippets** (`/snippets`)
Code fragments and utility functions that can be reused across projects. These are building blocks for AI applications.

**Coming soon:**
- Common AI patterns and utilities
- Integration helpers
- Prompt engineering templates

## üöÄ Getting Started

Each demo, experiment, and snippet includes its own README with specific setup instructions. Generally, you'll need:

1. **Prerequisites**
   - AWS Account with appropriate service access
   - Python 3.9+ or Node.js 16+ (depending on the sample)
   - AWS CLI configured with credentials

2. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/sample-ai-possibilities.git
   cd sample-ai-possibilities
   ```

3. **Navigate to a specific sample**
   ```bash
   # For a demo
   cd demos/recipe-genie-chatbot
   
   # Follow the README.md instructions in that directory
   ```
